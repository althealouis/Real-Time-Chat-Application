HTTP status codes are standard response codes given by web servers on the internet. They provide information about the status of a request made by a client to the server. Here's a brief overview of some commonly encountered HTTP status codes:

1xx Informational: These are provisional responses and indicate that the request has been received and the process is continuing.

100 Continue: The server has received the initial part of the request and is continuing with the process.
101 Switching Protocols: The server agrees to switch protocols to the one specified in the upgrade header of the request.

2xx Success: These indicate that the client's request was received, understood, and accepted.

200 OK: The request has succeeded.
201 Created: The request has been fulfilled and a new resource has been created.
204 No Content: The server has successfully fulfilled the request, but there is no additional content to send.

3xx Redirection: These indicate that further action needs to be taken by the client to fulfill the request.

301 Moved Permanently: The requested URL has been permanently moved to a new location.
302 Found: The requested URL has been temporarily moved to a different location.
304 Not Modified: The client's cached version is still valid, and there's no need to transfer the requested resource again.
4xx Client Errors: These indicate that there was a problem with the client's request.
